# Physical-AI Packaging Strategy

Two repositories. Two PyPI distributions. One namespace.

**Repos:**

- [`physical-ai`](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/physical-ai) — runtime/inference library (currently private, closed-source)
- [`physical-ai-studio`](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/physical-ai-studio) — training SDK + application (public, open-source under Apache 2.0)

**PyPI distributions:**

- `physicalai` — lightweight runtime (inference, capture, robot, benchmark runner)
- `physicalai-train` — training SDK (policies, data, eval, gyms, benchmark presets)

Both distributions share the `physicalai` namespace via PEP 420 implicit namespace packaging.

---

## Constraints

- Only **two repos** available (no third repo option)
- **No circular dependencies** — dependency flows upward only
- **Lightweight base install** — `pip install physicalai` must not pull torch/lightning
- **No `__init__.py` at namespace root** — PEP 420 requirement for namespace split
- Core APIs return plain `dict`/`np.ndarray` only
- Studio is **not** a PyPI package — built via npm or Docker only
- Training SDK **is** published to PyPI as `physicalai-train`
- **Open-source constraint** — `physical-ai-studio` is public (Apache 2.0). Code cannot be _removed_ from the OSS repo after community adoption. Modules needed in `physical-ai` must be **duplicated** (developed independently in both repos), not moved. The OSS repo must remain fully functional as a standalone training SDK.

---

## Phased Rollout

### Phase 1 — Open-Source Launch - [DONE]

`physical-ai-studio` goes public with the codebase renamed from `getiaction` to `physicalai`. All Python modules ship inside a single distribution: `physicalai-train`.

```text
physical-ai-studio/                    # goes public
├── application/                       # FastAPI + React (not packaged)
└── library/
    ├── pyproject.toml                 # name = "physicalai-train"
    └── src/physicalai/
        ├── train/                     # Trainer, Lightning integration
        ├── policies/                  # ACT, Pi0, SmolVLA, GR00T
        ├── data/                      # DataModule, Observation
        ├── benchmark/                 # Benchmarking
        ├── eval/                      # Rollout evaluation
        ├── gyms/                      # Sim environments
        ├── inference/                 # InferenceModel (temporary)
        ├── cli/                       # CLI
        ├── config/                    # Configuration
        └── devices/                   # Device utilities
        # NO physicalai/__init__.py

physical-ai/                           # stays private/empty
```

**Install experience:**

```bash
pip install physicalai-train           # gets everything
```

```python
from physicalai.train import Trainer
from physicalai.policies import ACT
from physicalai.inference import InferenceModel
```

**Why this works:** Shipping everything as `physicalai-train` avoids claiming the `physicalai` PyPI name prematurely. The `physicalai` name is reserved for the lightweight runtime that ships from `physical-ai` once that repo goes public. PEP 420 compliance (no namespace `__init__.py`) is enforced from day one so that Phase 2 is a clean split, not a rewrite.

---

### Phase 2 — Runtime Development (Code Duplication)

Timeline: when `physical-ai` repo goes public.

Develop runtime modules **independently** in the `physical-ai` repo. Because `physical-ai-studio` is open-source, runtime modules (`inference/`, `capture/`, `robot/`, `benchmark/`) cannot be removed from studio — they must be **duplicated** in `physical-ai` and developed in parallel. `physicalai-train` stays in studio and declares `physicalai>=0.1.0` as a dependency.

```text
physical-ai/                           # now public
├── pyproject.toml                     # name = "physicalai"
└── src/physicalai/
    ├── inference/                     # InferenceModel (independent implementation)
    ├── capture/                       # Camera interfaces
    ├── robot/                         # Robot ABC
    ├── benchmark/                     # BenchmarkRunner, protocols (numpy-only)
    # NO physicalai/__init__.py

physical-ai-studio/                    # training stays here, still fully functional
├── application/                       # FastAPI + React
└── library/
    ├── pyproject.toml                 # name = "physicalai-train"
    │                                  # depends on: physicalai>=0.1.0
    └── src/physicalai/
        ├── train/
        ├── inference/                 # InferenceModel (kept for backward compat)
        ├── policies/
        ├── data/
        ├── eval/
        ├── gyms/
        ├── benchmark/                 # BenchmarkRunner (kept for backward compat)
        ├── cli/
        └── config/
        # NO physicalai/__init__.py
```

**Duplication strategy:** Runtime modules exist in both repos during this phase. The `physical-ai` repo is the **canonical runtime** — it defines the public API and ships `physicalai` to PyPI. The `physical-ai-studio` repo retains its copies for backward compatibility and to remain a fully functional standalone training SDK. Over time, `physicalai-train` should prefer importing from the `physicalai` dependency rather than its own copies, but both must work independently.

**Install experience:**

```bash
pip install physicalai                 # runtime only — no torch
pip install physicalai-train           # auto-pulls physicalai
```

```python
# Runtime only
from physicalai.inference import InferenceModel
from physicalai.capture import Camera

# Training (requires physicalai-train)
from physicalai.train import Trainer
from physicalai.policies import ACT
```

**What gets duplicated:**

| Module       | OSS (`physical-ai-studio`)     | Runtime (`physical-ai`)        | Notes                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inference/` | Kept (backward compat)         | New canonical implementation   | Studio copy becomes thin wrapper or deprecated over time |
| `capture/`   | New (if developed there first) | Canonical implementation       | May be developed directly in `physical-ai`               |
| `robot/`     | New (if developed there first) | Canonical implementation       | May be developed directly in `physical-ai`               |
| `benchmark/` | Kept (training benchmarks)     | New runtime-focused benchmarks | Different focus: training eval vs runtime benchmarks     |

**Prerequisite:** Clean up cross-module imports. Currently `inference/` imports from `data/` and `policies/` — these dependencies must be broken before the runtime copy can stand alone.

**Sync strategy:** API contracts (interfaces, data formats, manifest schema) must be aligned across both repos. Use shared test fixtures and integration tests to catch divergence early. Designate one developer as the "sync owner" per duplicated module.

---

### Phase 3 — Training Consolidation (Pending Stakeholder Alignment)

Timeline: requires executive approval.

Duplicate training modules from studio into `physical-ai`. Both distributions publish from a single repo. Studio becomes a pure application (FastAPI + React). Note: this does **not** remove training code from the OSS repo — `physical-ai-studio` retains its library code for existing open-source users, but stops publishing new versions of `physicalai-train`. The `physical-ai` repo becomes the sole publisher of both PyPI distributions.

```text
physical-ai/                           # owns all Python code (publishes both dists)
├── packages/
│   ├── physicalai/                    # runtime dist
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src/physicalai/
│   │       ├── inference/
│   │       ├── capture/
│   │       ├── robot/
│   │       ├── benchmark/
│   │       # NO physicalai/__init__.py
│   └── physicalai-train/              # training dist
│       ├── pyproject.toml
│       └── src/physicalai/
│           ├── train/
│           ├── policies/
│           ├── data/
│           ├── eval/
│           ├── gyms/
│           ├── cli/
│           └── config/
│           # NO physicalai/__init__.py

physical-ai-studio/                    # pure application
├── application/
│   ├── backend/                       # FastAPI
│   └── ui/                            # React
└── pyproject.toml                     # depends on physicalai-train (from physical-ai)

physical-ai-studio/ (library/)         # frozen / archived
└── library/                           # retained for OSS users, no new releases
    ├── pyproject.toml                 # last published version
    └── src/physicalai/                # code stays for existing installs
```

**Why this is the end-state:** Library code belongs in a library repo. Studio becomes a consumer, not a publisher. One repo for all Python packaging simplifies CI, versioning, and release coordination.

**Open-source impact:** The `physical-ai-studio` library directory is **not deleted** — it remains available for anyone who cloned or forked the OSS repo. However, new development and PyPI releases move to `physical-ai`. A deprecation notice in the OSS repo's README directs users to `pip install physicalai-train` (now published from `physical-ai`).

**Why it needs approval:** Moving training out of studio changes repo ownership boundaries. This is an organizational decision, not a technical one. If rejected, Phase 2 is a stable long-term state — training stays in studio, runtime lives in `physical-ai`, namespace split works either way. The duplication overhead in Phase 2 is manageable because the runtime modules are relatively small and have clear API boundaries.

## Package Architecture

### Namespace Split

Both distributions contribute subpackages under the `physicalai` namespace. Neither distribution owns the namespace root.

```text
physicalai/                            # PEP 420 namespace — no __init__.py
├── inference/    → physicalai dist    # runtime
├── capture/      → physicalai dist
├── robot/        → physicalai dist
├── benchmark/    → physicalai dist    # evaluation mechanism (numpy-only)
├── train/        → physicalai-train   # training
├── policies/     → physicalai-train
├── data/         → physicalai-train
├── eval/         → physicalai-train   # rollout loop, video recording (torch)
├── gyms/         → physicalai-train   # simulation environments (heavy deps)
├── cli/          → physicalai-train
└── config/       → physicalai-train
```

Training subpackages (`train/`, `policies/`, `data/`, etc.) are siblings under `physicalai`, not nested under `physicalai.train.*`. This keeps imports flat and natural.

### Dependency Direction

```text
physicalai-train  →  physicalai  →  (numpy, opencv, etc.)
     │                    │
     │                    └── no torch, no lightning
     └── torch, lightning, policies, data
```

`physicalai-train` depends on `physicalai`. Never the reverse.

### Install Matrix

| User          | Install                        | Gets                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Edge deployer | `pip install physicalai`       | Inference, camera, robot, benchmark runner |
| ML researcher | `pip install physicalai-train` | Everything (auto-pulls physicalai)         |
| Studio user   | Docker / npm build             | Application with physicalai-train baked in |

### Import Examples

```python
# Runtime only (pip install physicalai)
from physicalai.inference import InferenceModel
from physicalai.capture import RealSenseCamera
from physicalai.robot import Robot
from physicalai.benchmark import BenchmarkRunner, BenchmarkResults

# Training (pip install physicalai-train)
from physicalai.train import Trainer
from physicalai.policies import ACT
from physicalai.data import LeRobotDataModule
from physicalai.gyms import LiberoGym
```

### Critical Rule

**No `__init__.py` at `src/physicalai/` in either distribution.** This is the PEP 420 namespace mechanism. If either package adds a `physicalai/__init__.py`, the namespace breaks — only one distribution's subpackages will be visible.

### IDE Configuration (PEP 420 Namespace Packages)

**End users** (`pip install` into the same virtualenv): No configuration needed. Pyright/Pylance, PyCharm, and mypy correctly discover both distributions under the `physicalai` namespace. Go-to-definition, autocomplete, and type checking work out of the box.

**Phase 1 & Phase 3 developers** (single repo): No issues. All source files are in one workspace.

**Phase 2 developers** (two repos, editable installs): Requires a one-line IDE config so the type checker sees both source trees.

**VS Code (Pylance)**:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["../physical-ai/library/src"]
}
```

**PyCharm**: Right-click the second repo's `src/` directory → Mark Directory As → Sources Root.

#### Why PEP 420 Over `pkgutil.extend_path()`

Google Cloud (`google.cloud.*`) and Azure SDK (`azure.*`) use `pkgutil.extend_path()` with explicit `__init__.py` files. Pyright only resolves the first namespace instance with this approach ([pyright#2882](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/2882) — closed "as designed"). Pure PEP 420 (no `__init__.py`) is explicitly supported by Pyright and avoids this limitation entirely.

## PoC Validation

A proof-of-concept validates PEP 420 namespace packaging across both single-repo and two-repo scenarios (22/22 tests pass). See `poc/` directory to reproduce.

## Alternatives Considered

The chosen approach (two separate distributions with PEP 420 namespace) is documented above. Two alternatives were evaluated and rejected:

### Option A — Single Package With Extras

Ship everything as one distribution. Use extras for heavy dependencies (`pip install physicalai[train]`).

```python
pip install physicalai              # runtime only
pip install physicalai[train]       # adds torch, lightning
```

**Why rejected:**

- Requires strict lazy-import discipline across the entire codebase
- Risk of accidental heavy imports at runtime — one `import torch` at module level breaks lightweight install
- CI must test both base and extras installs
- Current codebase has module-level torch imports in `data/` and `policies/` — would need extensive refactoring to make extras safe
- No hard dependency boundary — discipline is the only guard

### Option C — Training Under Studio Branding

Keep training SDK in `physical-ai-studio` repo published under a different package name (not `physicalai.*`).

```bash
pip install physicalai              # runtime
pip install physical-ai-studio-sdk  # training
```

**Why rejected:**

- Training lives under "studio" branding, which is confusing — studio is a UI application
- Breaks the `physicalai.*` namespace unity — users need to know two unrelated package names
- ML researchers searching PyPI for "physicalai" won't discover the training SDK
- Studio repo mixes UI application and library concerns permanently
