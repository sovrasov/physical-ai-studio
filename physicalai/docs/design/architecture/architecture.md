# Physical‑AI Architecture (physicalai runtime)

Universal physical‑AI runtime that runs policies from multiple frameworks (physicalai-train, LeRobot, custom) through a unified API.

---

## Overview

**physicalai** is the universal physical‑AI runtime. It provides a unified runtime and CLI for running policies from physicalai-train, LeRobot, or any custom framework — using built‑in format loaders and runners that require zero external dependencies.

**Key Features:**

- Unified API (`InferenceModel`)
- Unified manifest format (`manifest.json`) — no training framework imports needed
- Built‑in runners (SinglePassRunner, IterativeRunner, ActionChunkingRunner) — covers common execution patterns
- External plugin support for exotic patterns only (user's own package)
- Configuration-driven workflows
- CLI for edge and server deployment

---

## Personas & Use‑Cases (Quick Start)

### Persona A — physicalai-train user (exported policy)

**Goal:** Run a physicalai-train policy with the physical‑AI runtime.

**Install:**

```bash
pip install physicalai
```

**Python (policy‑specific API):**

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

policy = InferenceModel("hf://physicalai-train/act_policy")
action = policy.select_action(observation)
```

**CLI:**

```bash
physicalai run --model hf://physicalai-train/act_policy --robot robot.yaml
```

---

### Persona B — LeRobot user (PolicyPackage)

> **Note:** LeRobot PolicyPackage export is our proposal to the LeRobot team — not yet accepted upstream. This persona assumes the proposed format is adopted.

**Goal:** Run a LeRobot policy package through physicalai runtime.

**Install:**

```bash
pip install physicalai
```

**Python (policy‑specific API):**

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

policy = InferenceModel("hf://lerobot/pi0")
action = policy.select_action(observation)
```

**CLI:**

```bash
physicalai run --model hf://lerobot/pi0 --robot robot.yaml
```

---

### Persona C — Custom model from a standalone GitHub repo

**Goal:** Add support for a new model (custom framework) with an exotic execution pattern not covered by built‑in runners.

**External plugin (editable install):**

```bash
pip install -e ./dreamzero/physicalai_plugin
```

**Model manifest (in your export directory):**

```json
{
  "format": "policy_package",
  "version": "1.0",
  "robots": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "type": "SO-100",
      "state": { "shape": [6], "dtype": "float32" },
      "action": { "shape": [6], "dtype": "float32" }
    }
  ],
  "cameras": [
    {
      "name": "wrist",
      "shape": [3, 480, 640],
      "dtype": "uint8"
    }
  ],
  "policy": {
    "name": "dreamzero",
    "kind": "custom"
  },
  "runner": {
    "class_path": "physicalai_plugin.runner.DreamZeroRunner"
  },
  "preprocessors": [{ "class_path": "physicalai_plugin.pre.DreamZeroPre" }],
  "postprocessors": [{ "class_path": "physicalai_plugin.post.DreamZeroPost" }]
}
```

**Python (unified API):**

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

model = InferenceModel("./exports/dreamzero")
outputs = model(inputs)
```

## Architecture

```text
                physicalai (runtime)
                        │
          ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
          │             │             │
    manifest.json    built‑in      external plugins
    (unified format  runners       (user's own package,
     for all models) (SinglePass,   exotic patterns only)
                     Iterative,
                     ActionChunking)
                        │
                        ▼
              physicalai.inference
           (domain-agnostic modular layer)
```

**Key principle:** physicalai owns physical‑AI orchestration, hardware lifecycle, and safety. All models use a unified `manifest.json` format. Built‑in runners handle common execution patterns (physicalai-train, LeRobot). External plugins are only for exotic execution patterns — user's own package, user's own dependencies. Backend execution lives in the inference core (`physicalai.inference`), a domain‑agnostic modular layer inside the runtime that can be silently extracted as a separate package later.

---

## Design Choice: Who Owns the Interfaces?

Two approaches for **camera + robot + inference interfaces**. Both are technically valid. We recommend Option 1.

### Option 1 — physicalai owns the interfaces (recommended)

```text
physicalai
  ├─ camera interfaces (physicalai.capture)
  ├─ robot interfaces  (physicalai.robot)
  ├─ inference core    (physicalai.inference — domain-agnostic modular layer)
  └─ format loaders + runners + CLI
          ▲
          │ depends on (hard dependency)
  physicalai-train (training)
```

**Why this works:**

- **No circular dependency.** physicalai-train depends on physicalai. physicalai loads models at runtime via format loaders and `class_path` — never imports training code at install time. One-directional dependency.
- **Fewer repos (2 instead of 5+).** Only physical-ai and physical-ai-studio. Less coordination overhead, simpler CI, fewer version matrices.
- **One package for all hardware interfaces.** Teams install physicalai and get cameras, robots, inference, CLI, safety — everything needed for deployment.
- **Future split is cheap.** Camera/robot interfaces live in clean subpackages (`physicalai.capture`, `physicalai.robot`) with no cross-imports. If a vision-only consumer needs camera-api standalone, extract it then. Merging repos later is much harder than splitting.

**Dependency graph:**

```text
physicalai-train → physicalai
                  │
                  ├── physicalai.capture     (clean subpackage)
                  ├── physicalai.robot       (clean subpackage)
                  ├── physicalai.inference   (domain-agnostic modular layer)
                  └── physicalai.runtime     (format loaders, runners, CLI, safety)
```

**Condition:** Camera/robot subpackages must have **zero imports** from the rest of physicalai. This is enforced by import linting and makes future extraction trivial.

**Trade-off:** `pip install physicalai-train` pulls physicalai as a dependency. This is acceptable because training needs hardware interfaces for teleoperation and data collection.

### Option 2 — shared interfaces in separate packages

```text
camera‑api   robot‑api   inferencekit (base)
    ▲            ▲              ▲
    │            │              │
    ├────────────┼──────────────┤
    │            │              │
physicalai-train   physicalai
   (training)        (runtime)
```

**When to prefer Option 2:**

- You have **concrete vision-only consumers** that need camera-api without physicalai.
- You need physicalai-train installable **without** physicalai (e.g., for CI environments that only run training, no hardware).
- Multiple teams independently maintain camera and robot interfaces with separate release cadences.

**Cost:** 5+ repos instead of 2. Every release requires coordinating versions across camera-api, robot-api, physicalai, and physicalai-train. This is real overhead.

**Verdict:** Option 2 is the right choice when the ecosystem is large enough to justify the coordination cost. Start with Option 1 and split when a concrete consumer forces it.

**Important:** Both diagrams show **dependency direction**, not runtime dataflow.

---

## Dependency vs. Runtime Flow (Clarification)

### Dependency (who depends on whom)

```text
physicalai-train → physicalai
```

physicalai-train depends on physicalai for camera/robot interfaces and the inference runtime.
physicalai contains the inference core (`physicalai.inference`) as an internal modular layer.
physicalai loads models at runtime via format loaders (no install-time dependency on training code).

### Runtime dataflow (what happens during inference)

```text
camera → observation → preprocessor (built‑in or external)
     → runner.run(adapter, inputs) → postprocessor → action → robot
```

---

## Deep‑Dive: How the Engine Works

This section explains **how physicalai resolves format loaders, builds `InferenceModel`, and executes inference**.

**Inference ownership (explicit):**

- **Inference core** (`physicalai.inference`) owns backend execution and the base `InferenceModel`
- **Built‑in runners/pre/post** own common execution patterns (SinglePass, Iterative, ActionChunking)
- **External plugins** own exotic execution patterns (user's own package)
- **physicalai** owns orchestration, hardware lifecycle, safety, and the unified API that loads models

### 1) Manifest Loading & Resolution

All models use `manifest.json` — a single, unified metadata format across physicalai-train, LeRobot, and custom models.

```text
model path/URI
     │
     ▼
manifest.json detection
     │
     ▼
manifest parser (built‑in)
     │
     ▼
built‑in runner + pre/post (or external class_path if exotic)
```

### 2) Manifest → Class Instantiation (class_path)

Runners and pre/post are wired by **class_path + init_args** in the manifest:

```text
manifest.json
  ├─ runner.class_path
  ├─ preprocessors[].class_path
  └─ postprocessors[].class_path
```

This allows **external plugins** (editable installs) without upstreaming. For most models, the manifest uses `policy.kind` to select built‑in runners shipped with the framework. The `class_path` mechanism is only needed for exotic patterns.

### 3) InferenceModel Runtime Flow

`InferenceModel` composes a pipeline:

```text
inputs
  ▼
preprocessors (built‑in or external)
  ▼
runner.run(adapter, inputs)
  ▼
postprocessors (built‑in or external)
  ▼
outputs / action
```

**Notes:**

- `select_action()` wraps `__call__` to return actions.
- Backends execute inside **inference core adapters** (`physicalai.inference.adapters`).

### 4) CLI → Config → Runtime Resolution

```text
CLI flags ─┐
           ├─► config resolver ─► runtime config ─► InferenceModel
deploy.yaml ┘

Priority: CLI > config file > defaults
```

### 5) Backend Selection Path

```text
model.backend / model.device
          │
          ▼
inference core adapter (physicalai.inference)
          │
          ▼
hardware runtime
```

Use the **Backend Selection Guide** to choose values per hardware.

### 6) Extension Points (Built‑in + External)

The framework ships built‑in implementations for common patterns. External plugins extend this for exotic cases:

- **Runners** (execution pattern) — built‑in: SinglePassRunner, IterativeRunner, ActionChunkingRunner; selected via `policy.kind` in manifest
- **Preprocessors** (input shaping) — built‑in: ObservationNormalizer, TensorResize
- **Postprocessors** (output shaping) — built‑in: ActionClamp
- **Callbacks** (instrumentation, safety, logging)

External plugins supply additional runners/pre/post via `class_path` in manifest.json.

See **[Inference Core Design](./inferencekit.md)** and **[LeRobot Integration](./lerobot.md)** for detailed contracts.

## Runtime Scope: What physicalai Must Own

physicalai is the **universal physical‑AI runtime** — not a thin shell that just loads models. To earn that title, it must own the domain-specific concerns that are common to **every** physical‑AI deployment, so teams only supply their model-specific logic.

**The promise:** You write a Runner and a Preprocessor. We handle cameras, robots, safety, episodes, and deployment.

### Engine Capabilities

| Capability                | What the runtime provides                                                                                                 | What teams still own                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observation pipeline**  | Camera → observation dict. Standard image capture, buffering, timestamp alignment. Same for every policy.                 | Custom observation transforms (e.g., cropping, proprioceptive features) go in preprocessors |
| **Safety runtime**        | Action clamping, velocity limits, workspace bounds, emergency stop. First-class runtime layer, not a callback.            | Domain-specific safety constraints (e.g., force limits for specific robots)                 |
| **Episode orchestration** | Run N episodes, reset between episodes, log results. The control loop is the same for every policy.                       | Episode termination conditions (policy-specific)                                            |
| **Device management**     | Robot connection lifecycle, camera initialization, cleanup on error.                                                      | Robot/camera driver implementations (SDK-specific)                                          |
| **Validation CLI**        | `physicalai validate ./exports/my_model` — verify manifest, check class_paths resolve, dry-run pipeline without hardware. | Model-specific validation (e.g., expected input shapes)                                     |
| **Format loading**        | Manifest resolution (`manifest.json`), class_path instantiation, `policy.kind` → runner mapping.                          | External plugin code (exotic runners, pre/post processors)                                  |
| **Unified API + CLI**     | `InferenceModel`, `physicalai run`, `physicalai serve`, config resolution.                                                | N/A                                                                                         |

### What this means for teams

Without the runtime, teams deploying a new model need to:

1. Wire camera capture and observation construction
2. Implement action safety and clamping
3. Write the episode loop (run, reset, log)
4. Manage robot/camera connections and cleanup
5. Build a CLI or script harness

With the runtime, teams supply a `manifest.json` pointing to built‑in runners and preprocessors (via `policy.kind`). The runtime handles everything else. Custom code is only needed for exotic execution patterns.

### Current vs Target State

| Capability                    | Current state                 | Target state                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Format loading + CLI + config | ✓ Designed                    | ✓ Ship as v1                                     |
| Observation pipeline          | Missing                       | v1 — required for "immediate deployment" promise |
| Safety runtime                | Partial (callback)            | v1 — promote to first-class runtime layer        |
| Episode orchestration         | Hinted in CLI (`--episodes`)  | v1 — `EpisodeRunner` abstraction                 |
| Device management             | Missing (lives in studio app) | v1 — `DeviceManager` for robot/camera lifecycle  |
| Validation CLI                | Missing                       | v1 — `physicalai validate`                       |

---

## InferenceModel Hierarchy

Three `InferenceModel` classes exist across the stack. This is intentional — each layer adds domain-specific behavior.

```text
physicalai.inference.InferenceModel      ← base: load model, run forward pass
        │
        │  subclasses / wraps
        ▼
physicalai.InferenceModel                ← adds: select_action(), reset(), safety,
        │                                   observation pipeline, episode management
        │  (physicalai-train uses this for deployment)
        │
        │  library-only shortcut
        ▼
physicalai-train.inference.InferenceModel ← re-exports physicalai.InferenceModel
                                            for library-only usage without deploying
                                            through the runtime
```

**Which one do users import?**

| Use case                           | Import                                                  | Why                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploying any policy (recommended) | `from physicalai import InferenceModel`                 | Full runtime: safety, observation pipeline, CLI integration |
| Raw inference without runtime      | `from physicalai.inference import InferenceModel`       | Just model + backend, no robotics concerns                  |
| physicalai-train scripts           | `from physicalai-train.inference import InferenceModel` | Convenience re-export; same as physicalai.InferenceModel    |

---

## Extending InferenceModel (Custom Subclasses)

Built‑in runners, preprocessors, postprocessors, and callbacks cover most customization. **Subclassing `InferenceModel` is for cases the built‑in components cannot express.**

### When built‑in components are enough (do NOT subclass)

| Need                                                  | Plugin             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Custom forward pass (chunking, iterative, multi-head) | **Runner**         |
| Transform inputs before inference                     | **Preprocessor**   |
| Transform outputs after inference                     | **Postprocessor**  |
| Cross-cutting concerns (timing, logging, safety)      | **Callback**       |
| Different hardware backend                            | **RuntimeAdapter** |

### When to subclass

| Need                                                                    | Why built‑in components aren't enough                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-model pipelines (model A feeds model B)                           | Orchestration _between_ pipeline steps changes        |
| Domain-specific convenience API (`warm_up()`, `reset()`, `calibrate()`) | New lifecycle methods the base class doesn't have     |
| Custom model loading that metadata.yaml can't express                   | Loading logic runs before components are instantiated |
| Stateful inference across calls (episode buffer, history window)        | State lives outside the single-call pipeline          |

### Where to subclass

Subclass at the **lowest layer that gives you what you need**:

```text
physicalai.inference.InferenceModel      ← subclass here for non-robotics domains
        │
        ▼
physicalai.InferenceModel                ← subclass here for robotics with custom orchestration
```

### Example: Multi-model pipeline

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

class PerceptionPolicyModel(InferenceModel):
    """Two-stage: perception model feeds policy model."""

    def __init__(self, policy_path: str, perception_path: str):
        super().__init__(policy_path)
        self.perception = InferenceModel(perception_path)

    def __call__(self, raw_observation):
        features = self.perception(raw_observation)
        return super().__call__(features)
```

### Example: Custom lifecycle methods

```python
from physicalai.inference import InferenceModel as BaseModel

class WarmableModel(BaseModel):
    """Adds warm-up pass for buffer pre-allocation."""

    def warm_up(self, dummy_input):
        """Run one forward pass to pre-allocate backend buffers."""
        self(dummy_input)

    def benchmark(self, input_data, n_iterations: int = 100):
        """Time N forward passes and return stats."""
        import time
        times = []
        for _ in range(n_iterations):
            start = time.perf_counter()
            self(input_data)
            times.append(time.perf_counter() - start)
        return {"mean_ms": sum(times) / len(times) * 1000, "n": n_iterations}
```

### Rules for subclasses

1. **Call `super().__init__()`** — metadata loading, component instantiation, and adapter setup happen there.
2. **Don't bypass the pipeline** — override `__call__` only to add steps _around_ `super().__call__()`, not to replace it.
3. **Keep built‑in components working** — a subclass should still load Runner/Pre/Post from metadata. If your subclass ignores metadata, you've left the ecosystem.
4. **Prefer composition over inheritance** — if you need two models, compose two `InferenceModel` instances (like the multi-model example above) rather than merging their logic into one class.

## Custom Model Enablement (5‑Minute Guide)

This section answers: **"I have a new model. How do I deploy it with physical‑ai‑framework, right now, without upstreaming anything?"**

### Minimum viable structure

You need two things: an **export directory** with your model and metadata, and a **Python package** with your custom Runner/Preprocessor (if the built-in ones don't suffice).

#### Case 1: Standard single-pass model (no custom code needed)

If your model is a standard ONNX/OpenVINO model that takes inputs and produces outputs in one forward pass, you need **zero custom code**:

```text
exports/my_model/
├── model.onnx
└── manifest.json
```

```json
{
  "format": "policy_package",
  "version": "1.0",
  "robots": [...],
  "cameras": [...],
  "policy": {
    "name": "my_model",
    "kind": "single_pass"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "onnx": "model.onnx"
  }
}
```

```python
from physical_ai import InferenceModel

model = InferenceModel("./exports/my_model")
outputs = model(inputs)
```

Done. No plugin package. No entry points. No upstream PR.

#### Case 2: Custom preprocessing or execution pattern

Your model needs custom observation normalization and a non-standard execution pattern (e.g., iterative denoising):

**Step 1 — Create a minimal plugin package:**

```text
my_policy_plugin/
├── pyproject.toml
└── my_policy_plugin/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── preprocessor.py
    └── runner.py
```

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "my-policy-plugin"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = ["physicalai"]
```

```python
# my_policy_plugin/preprocessor.py
from physicalai.inference.preprocessors import Preprocessor

class MyObservationNormalizer(Preprocessor):
    def __init__(self, mean, std):
        self.mean = mean
        self.std = std

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict) -> dict:
        inputs["observation"] = (inputs["observation"] - self.mean) / self.std
        return inputs
```

```python
# my_policy_plugin/runner.py
from physicalai.inference.runners import InferenceRunner

class MyIterativeRunner(InferenceRunner):
    def __init__(self, num_steps: int = 10):
        self.num_steps = num_steps

    def run(self, adapter, inputs):
        x = inputs["noise"]
        for step in range(self.num_steps):
            inputs["x_t"] = x
            inputs["timestep"] = step / self.num_steps
            v = adapter.predict(inputs)["velocity"]
            x = x + v / self.num_steps
        return {"action": x}

    def reset(self):
        pass
```

**Step 2 — Install locally (editable):**

```bash
pip install -e ./my_policy_plugin
```

**Step 3 — Point manifest at your classes:**

```json
{
  "format": "policy_package",
  "version": "1.0",
  "robots": [...],
  "cameras": [...],
  "policy": {
    "name": "my_model",
    "kind": "custom"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "onnx": "model.onnx"
  },
  "runner": {
    "class_path": "my_policy_plugin.runner.MyIterativeRunner",
    "init_args": {
      "num_steps": 20
    }
  },
  "preprocessors": [
    {
      "class_path": "my_policy_plugin.preprocessor.MyObservationNormalizer",
      "init_args": {
        "mean": 0.5,
        "std": 0.2
      }
    }
  ],
  "postprocessors": []
}
```

**Step 4 — Run:**

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

model = InferenceModel("./exports/my_model")
action = model.select_action(observation)
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
physicalai run --model ./exports/my_model --robot robot.yaml
```

**Step 5 — Validate (without hardware):**

```bash
physicalai validate ./exports/my_model
# ✓ manifest.json found
# ✓ runner class_path resolves: my_policy_plugin.runner.MyIterativeRunner
# ✓ preprocessor class_path resolves: my_policy_plugin.preprocessor.MyObservationNormalizer
# ✓ model.onnx loadable with onnx backend
# ✓ dry-run pipeline: inputs → preprocessors → runner → postprocessors → outputs
```

### Decision flowchart: Runner vs Preprocessor vs Postprocessor

Teams often ask: "Where does my logic go?"

| Question                                                                          | Answer                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does it transform inputs before the model sees them?                              | **Preprocessor** (e.g., normalize observations, resize images) |
| Does it transform outputs after the model produces them?                          | **Postprocessor** (e.g., unnormalize actions, clamp to range)  |
| Does it change _how_ inference runs (multiple passes, action queuing, denoising)? | **Runner** (e.g., iterative diffusion, action chunking)        |
| Is it cross-cutting (logging, timing, safety) and shouldn't modify model code?    | **Callback**                                                   |

## Packaging Independence

Teams can **package and distribute their inference pipeline independently**, without any changes to physicalai.

### How it works

The `class_path` mechanism means physicalai never needs to know about your code at install time. It loads your classes dynamically from `manifest.json`. As long as your package is installed in the same Python environment, it works.

### Three levels of integration

| Level                                    | What you do                                                         | Who can use it                   | Upstream needed?                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local (editable install)**             | `pip install -e ./my_plugin` + manifest.json with class_paths       | You and your team                | No                                               |
| **Published (PyPI / internal registry)** | `pip install my-policy-plugin` + manifest.json                      | Anyone who installs your package | No                                               |
| **Upstreamed (entry points)**            | Add `[project.entry-points."physicalai.plugins"]` to pyproject.toml | Auto-discovered by physicalai    | PR to register name, but code stays in your repo |

### Local → Published → Upstream workflow

**Day 1 (local):** Team develops and tests with editable install. No coordination.

```bash
pip install -e ./my_policy_plugin
pip install physicalai[onnx]
physicalai run --model ./exports/my_model --robot robot.yaml
```

**Day 30 (published):** Team publishes to PyPI or internal registry. Other teams can use it.

```bash
pip install my-policy-plugin physicalai[onnx]
physicalai run --model ./exports/my_model --robot robot.yaml
```

**Day 60 (upstreamed, optional):** Team adds entry points so physical‑ai‑framework auto-discovers the plugin.

```toml
# my_policy_plugin/pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."physicalai.plugins"]
my_policy = "my_policy_plugin:MyPolicyPlugin"
```

Now `physicalai run` auto-discovers the plugin without explicit class_paths in the manifest. But this step is **optional** — class_path in manifest.json always works without entry points.

## CLI Reference

### Run Inference

```bash
# Run policy inference on robot
physicalai run \
    --model ./exports/act_policy \
    --robot robot.yaml \
    --episodes 10

# With explicit backend
physicalai run \
    --model ./exports/act_policy \
    --robot robot.yaml \
    --backend openvino \
    --device CPU
```

### Serve Model

```bash
# Start inference server
physicalai serve \
    --model ./exports/act_policy \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8080
```

### Export Policy

```bash
# Export trained policy to deployment format
physicalai export \
    --checkpoint ./checkpoints/act_policy \
    --output ./exports \
    --backend onnx
```

---

## Configuration

### Deployment Configuration

```yaml
# deploy.yaml
model:
  path: ./exports/act_policy
  backend: openvino
  device: CPU

robot:
  type: so101
  port: /dev/ttyUSB0
  cameras:
    top:
      type: webcam
      index: 0

inference:
  rate_hz: 30.0
  num_episodes: 10

safety:
  action_min: -1.0
  action_max: 1.0
  velocity_limit: 0.5
```

### Running from Config

```bash
physicalai run --config deploy.yaml
```

---

## Python API

### API Entry Points

**InferenceModel** = unified API. Use `__call__` for raw outputs or `select_action()` for observation → action.

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

model = InferenceModel("hf://physicalai-train/act_policy")
outputs = model(model_inputs)
action = outputs["action"]
```

**Policy‑style usage:**

```python
from physicalai import InferenceModel

policy = InferenceModel("hf://physicalai-train/act_policy")
action = policy.select_action(observation)
```

### Training SDK usage (library-only)

```python
from physicalai.inference import InferenceModel  # Library-only usage; use physicalai CLI for deployment

policy = InferenceModel("./exports/act_policy")
action = policy.select_action(observation)
```

---

## Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Edge Deployment (Jetson)

```yaml
# jetson_deploy.yaml
model:
  path: ./exports/act_policy
  backend: onnx
  device: cuda # TensorRT acceleration

robot:
  type: so101
  port: /dev/ttyUSB0

inference:
  rate_hz: 30.0
  warmup_steps: 10 # Warm up GPU
```

```bash
physicalai run --config jetson_deploy.yaml
```

### Pattern 2: Intel CPU Deployment

```yaml
# intel_deploy.yaml
model:
  path: ./exports/act_policy
  backend: openvino
  device: CPU # or GPU for integrated graphics

robot:
  type: so101
  port: /dev/ttyUSB0

inference:
  rate_hz: 30.0
```

### Pattern 3: Server Deployment

```yaml
# server_deploy.yaml
model:
  path: ./exports/act_policy
  backend: onnx
  device: cuda:0

server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080
  workers: 1
```

```bash
physicalai serve --config server_deploy.yaml
```

## Backend Selection Guide

| Hardware      | Recommended Backend  | Device |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Intel CPU     | `openvino`           | `CPU`  |
| Intel GPU     | `openvino`           | `GPU`  |
| NVIDIA GPU    | `onnx` or `tensorrt` | `cuda` |
| NVIDIA Jetson | `onnx` (TensorRT EP) | `cuda` |
| Apple Silicon | `onnx` (CoreML EP)   | `cpu`  |
| Edge/mobile   | `executorch`         | `cpu`  |

---

## Installation

```bash
# Core package (inference only — includes format loaders + built-in runners)
pip install physicalai

# With specific backend
pip install physicalai[openvino]
pip install physicalai[onnx-gpu]
pip install physicalai[tensorrt]

# All backends
pip install physicalai[all]
```

**No `physicalai[train]` or `physicalai[lerobot]` needed.** The unified `manifest.json` format is parsed natively. Built‑in runners (SinglePassRunner, IterativeRunner, ActionChunkingRunner) handle common execution patterns. No training framework required at deployment time.

## Installation Matrix (What You Get)

| Install command          | Includes                                                | Excludes          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `physicalai`             | Core runtime + CLI + manifest loader + built‑in runners | No heavy backends |
| `physicalai[openvino]`   | Core + OpenVINO runtime                                 | No other backends |
| `physicalai[onnx-gpu]`   | Core + ONNX Runtime (GPU)                               | No other backends |
| `physicalai[tensorrt]`   | Core + TensorRT                                         | No other backends |
| `physicalai[executorch]` | Core + ExecuTorch runtime                               | No other backends |
| `physicalai[all]`        | Core + all backends                                     | —                 |

**Note:** No `[train]` or `[lerobot]` extras exist. The unified `manifest.json` format and built‑in runners handle both frameworks natively. External plugins for exotic patterns are the user's own `pip install`.
