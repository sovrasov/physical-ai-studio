"""Action-chunking inference runner (decorator).

Wraps any ``InferenceRunner`` to add temporal action buffering.  The inner
runner produces an output dict whose action value has shape
``(batch, horizon, action_dim)``.  This wrapper queues the individual
timesteps, dispensing one per call.  Only invokes the inner runner again
when the queue is exhausted.

This is the GoF Decorator pattern: ``ActionChunking`` *is* an
``InferenceRunner`` and *has* an ``InferenceRunner``.

    """Wrap a runner with temporal action buffering.

    On the first call (or when the queue is empty), delegates to the
    inner runner which returns an output dict containing an action with
    shape ``(batch, chunk_size, action_dim)``.  All chunk steps are
    enqueued and one is returned.  Subsequent calls pop from the queue
    without running inference.

    Args:
        runner: The inner runner to delegate inference to.
        chunk_size: Number of actions per chunk.  Must match the inner
            runner's output temporal dimension.
        action_key: Key in the runner output dict that holds the action
            tensor.  Defaults to ``"action"``.

    Examples:
        Wrap a single-pass runner with action chunking:

        >>> runner = ActionChunking(SinglePass(), chunk_size=10)
        >>> outputs = runner.run(adapter, inputs)  # runs inference, queues 10 actions
        >>> outputs = runner.run(adapter, inputs)  # pops from queue, no inference

        >>> runner = ActionChunking(FlowMatching(num_steps=20), chunk_size=5)
