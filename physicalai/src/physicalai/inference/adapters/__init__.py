"""Inference adapters for different backend runtimes.

Adapters are discovered through :class:`RuntimeAdapterRegistry`.  This
package ships the ``onnx`` and ``openvino`` backends only — they
self-register on import below.

Additional backends are contributed by other distributions sharing the
``physicalai`` namespace via the ``physicalai.inference.adapters``
:mod:`importlib.metadata` entry-point group.  Each such entry point names
a callable ``register(registry)`` that populates the shared
:data:`backend_registry`.  Lightweight registration entry points (no heavy
imports) let third parties expose their backends — and in particular
their file extensions for auto-detection — without forcing this package
to know about them.

Use :func:`get_adapter` to obtain an adapter instance for a given backend.
