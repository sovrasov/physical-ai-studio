"""Lazy registration of ``physicalai-train`` inference adapters.

This module is discovered through the ``physicalai.inference.adapters``
entry-point group and registers Torch and ExecuTorch as **lazy** backends
on the shared :data:`backend_registry`.  Importing this module is cheap —
it does not import torch or executorch.  The heavy adapter modules are
loaded only when a user actually requests one of those backends.
