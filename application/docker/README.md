# Deploying Physical AI Studio with Docker

Physical AI Studio is a framework for training and deploying Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models for robotic imitation learning. This guide covers running Physical AI Studio as a
Docker container with support for CPU, Intel XPU, and NVIDIA CUDA hardware.

## Prerequisites

- [**Docker Engine**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) 24+ with **Docker Compose** v2
- A supported hardware backend:
  - **CPU** — any x86_64 system (default)
  - **Intel XPU** — Intel discrete/integrated GPU with Level Zero drivers on the host
  - **NVIDIA CUDA** — NVIDIA GPU with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed
- Robot hardware (optional): USB serial ports (`/dev/ttyACM*`), USB cameras (`/dev/video*`), or Intel RealSense cameras

## Quick Start

All commands should be run from the `application/docker/` directory.

```bash
# 1. Create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. (Optional) Set your hardware profile in .env
#    Edit COMPOSE_PROFILES to: cpu (default), xpu, or cuda

# 3. (Optional) Auto-detect host device GIDs for non-Debian systems
./setup-devices.sh

# 4. Start Physical AI Studio
docker compose up
```

Physical AI Studio will be available at **http://localhost:7860**.

The hardware backend is selected via the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` variable in `.env`.
To override it on the command line without editing `.env`:

```bash
# Intel XPU
docker compose --profile xpu up

# NVIDIA CUDA
docker compose --profile cuda up
```

To run in the background, add the `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done through the `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to get started.

### Environment Variables

| Variable           | Default                       | Description                                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `COMPOSE_PROFILES` | `cpu`                         | Hardware profile: `cpu`, `xpu`, or `cuda`                |
| `PORT`             | `7860`                        | Host port to expose the web UI and API                   |
| `REGISTRY`         | `ghcr.io/open-edge-platform/` | Container image registry                                 |
| `IMAGE_TAG`        | `latest`                      | Image version tag                                        |
| `APP_UID`          | `1000`                        | UID for the in-container user (match your host user)     |
| `APP_GID`          | `1000`                        | GID for the in-container user (match your host user)     |

| `PLUGDEV_GID`      | `plugdev` (group name)        | Host GID for the `plugdev` group (USB devices)           |
| `RENDER_GID`       | `render` (group name)         | Host GID for the `render` group (Intel GPU, XPU only)    |
| `HF_TOKEN`         | *(empty)*                     | Hugging Face access token for Hub-backed model downloads     |
| `HTTP_PROXY`       | *(empty)*                     | HTTP proxy for builds and runtime                        |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`      | *(empty)*                     | HTTPS proxy for builds and runtime                       |
| `NO_PROXY`         | *(empty)*                     | Proxy exclusion list                                     |

If you plan to train Hugging Face Hub-backed policies (for example, SmolVLA, Pi0,
and others), set `HF_TOKEN` in `.env` to avoid unauthenticated Hub access warnings.
See [Hugging Face Integration](../backend/docs/huggingface_integration.md) for token
creation and setup details.

## Hardware Targets

The Docker image is built in multiple variants, one per hardware backend.
The correct variant is selected automatically via Docker Compose profiles
(`COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `.env` or `--profile` on the command line).

| Profile | Service name                  | Additional system packages                 |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `cpu`   | `physical-ai-studio-cpu`      | None                                       |
| `xpu`   | `physical-ai-studio-xpu`      | Intel GPU runtime (Level Zero, OpenCL, VA) |
| `cuda`  | `physical-ai-studio-cuda`     | CUDA 12.8 runtime (cudart, cuBLAS, cuDNN)  |

## Hardware Access

The container needs access to host devices (serial ports, cameras, USB) to
communicate with robots and capture data. There are two modes:

### Option 1: Privileged Mode (default)

The default `docker-compose.yaml` runs the container in privileged mode. This
grants full access to all host devices with zero configuration:

```yaml
privileged: true
```

This is the easiest option and is recommended for development and prototyping.

### Option 2: Non-Privileged Mode (more secure)

For production or shared environments, you can restrict the container to only
the specific devices it needs. Edit the relevant service in `docker-compose.yaml`:

1. Comment out `privileged: true` in the `x-common` anchor
2. Uncomment the `devices` section and adjust the device paths to match your
   hardware:

```yaml
privileged: false
devices:
   # Servo USB connections
   - /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0
   - /dev/ttyACM1:/dev/ttyACM1
   # USB cameras
   - /dev/video0:/dev/video0
   - /dev/video2:/dev/video2
   # Intel RealSense (uncomment if needed)
   # - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
```

For **Intel XPU** in non-privileged mode, you also need to uncomment the
`group_add` and `devices` overrides in the `physical-ai-studio-xpu` service
to grant access to `/dev/dri/renderD*` render nodes:

```yaml
group_add:
  - "${DIALOUT_GID:-dialout}"
  - "${PLUGDEV_GID:-plugdev}"
  - "${VIDEO_GID:-video}"
  - "${RENDER_GID:-render}"   # Intel GPU render nodes
devices:
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri         # Intel GPU device nodes
```

### Device Group Setup (non-Debian hosts)

Docker resolves group names like `video` and `dialout` against the
*container's* `/etc/group`, not the host's. On Debian/Ubuntu, the GIDs
typically match. On other distros (Arch Linux, Fedora, etc.) they may differ,
which means the container process won't have permission to access devices.

Run the setup script to auto-detect your host's GIDs and write them to `.env`:

```bash
# Detect GIDs and write to .env
./setup-devices.sh

# Check GIDs without modifying .env
./setup-devices.sh --check
```

The script detects `VIDEO_GID`, `DIALOUT_GID`, and `PLUGDEV_GID`, checks
whether your user is a member of each group, and warns you if you need to
add yourself. For Intel XPU, also ensure your user is in the `render` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG video $USER
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
sudo usermod -aG render $USER   # Intel XPU only
# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
```

## Volumes and Data Persistence

The compose file defines two named volumes and one bind mount:

| Volume                       | Container path                                         | Purpose                                       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `physical-ai-studio-data`    | `/app/data`                                            | Application database and runtime data         |
| `physical-ai-studio-storage` | `/app/storage`                                         | Trained models, datasets, and other artifacts |
| *(bind mount)*               | `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration` (read-only) | Shared robot calibration data from the host   |

To inspect volume contents:

```bash
# List files in a volume
docker run --rm -v docker_physical-ai-studio-data:/data alpine ls -la /data

# Back up a volume
docker run --rm -v docker_physical-ai-studio-storage:/storage -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/physical-ai-studio-storage-backup.tar.gz -C /storage .
```

> [!NOTE]
> Docker Compose prefixes volume names with the project name (the directory name
> by default). When running from `application/docker/`, the actual volume names
> are `docker_physical-ai-studio-data` and `docker_physical-ai-studio-storage`.
> You can verify the exact volume names with `docker volume ls | grep physical-ai-studio`.

To reset all data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> **Warning:** `docker compose down -v` removes the named volumes and all data
> they contain (database, models, datasets). This cannot be undone.

## Building from Source

To build the Docker image locally instead of pulling a pre-built image:

```bash
# Build for CPU (default profile)
docker compose build

# Build for Intel XPU
docker compose --profile xpu build

# Build for NVIDIA CUDA
docker compose --profile cuda build
```

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build. The build context is the repository
root. Each profiled service targets the corresponding Dockerfile stage
(e.g. `physical-ai-studio-cuda`). Proxy environment variables from `.env`
are passed as build arguments automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Container fails to access serial ports or cameras

Ensure your host user is in the required device groups:

```bash
groups  # Check your current groups
sudo usermod -aG dialout,video,plugdev $USER
# Log out and back in
```

On non-Debian systems, also run `./setup-devices.sh` to set numeric GIDs
in `.env`.

### `ERROR: could not select device driver "" with capabilities: [[gpu]]`

This error only applies to the `cuda` profile. The NVIDIA Container Toolkit
is not installed or not configured. Follow the
[installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
and restart the Docker daemon. If you are not using an NVIDIA GPU, make sure
`COMPOSE_PROFILES` is set to `cpu` or `xpu` in your `.env` file.

### Out of shared memory (`RuntimeError: DataLoader worker ... is killed`)

The default configuration uses `ipc: host`, which shares the host's
`/dev/shm` (typically 50% of system RAM on Linux). This should be sufficient
for most workloads. If you cannot use `ipc: host` (e.g. in a multi-tenant
environment), comment it out and set an explicit `shm_size` instead:

```yaml
# ipc: host
shm_size: 16g  # adjust based on available RAM
```

### Proxy issues during build or runtime

Set the proxy variables in `.env`:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

These are passed to both the Docker build process and the running container.
